# Java directory

Here I keep some java exercises.

Note: these exercises were made to practice some programming logic concepts such as conditionals, loops, arrays and so on. __*They're not meant to be the most efficient and lean programs*__ they were to focus particularly on just one aspect of programming logic though. I tried as much as possible to stick to this given one aspect mainly looking forward to master it.

## basicSequential/

In here you'll find some basics i/o handling. I wrote some simple programs that read inputs from the user, process it and then print the output on the terminal.

## basicConditional/

In here you'll find some basics conditionals: if-else, if else-if and switch cases. Again I wrote some simple programs that read input from the user, process it  and then print the output on the terminal.

## basicLoop/

In here you'll find basics loops: while, do while and for. As mentioned above these programs also read and print data from the user

## basicArraynMatrix/

Finally in here you'll find basic arrays and matrix. The stated above also goes here.
