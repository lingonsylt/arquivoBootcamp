# Java directory

Here I keep some java exercises.

Note: these exercises were made to practice some programming logic concepts such as conditionals, loops, arrays and so on. __*They're not meant to be the most efficient and lean programs*__ they were to focus particularly on just one aspect of programming logic though. I tried as much as possible to stick to this given one aspect looking forward to practice and master it.

## basicSequential

In here you'll find some basic i/o handling. I wrote some simple programs that read inputs from the user, process it and then print the output on the terminal.
