    <p>John William Coltrane (September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist
        and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped
        pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty
        recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter
        Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music
        took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential
        saxophonists in music history. He received numerous posthumous awards, including
        canonization by the African Orthodox Church and a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. His second wife
        was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane. The couple had three children: John Jr.
        (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), also a
        saxophonist.</p>
